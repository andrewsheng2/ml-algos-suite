Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Suite!
This suite contains the following algorithms that you can run:

Regression (can be visualized with 1D Regression Dataset):
    1. Linear Regression
    2. Linear Regression with L2 Regularization
    3. Kernel Regression with Boxcar Kernel
    4. Kernel Regression with Linear Kernel
    5. Kernel Regression with Polynomial Kernel
    6. Kernel Regression with RBF Kernel

Classification (can be visualized with 1D Classification Dataset):
    7. Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent
    8. Logistic Regression using Newton's Method
    9. Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent with L2 Regularization
    10. Logistic Regression using Newton's Method with L2 Regularization

Classification (can be visualized with 2D Classification Dataset):
    11. Decision Tree using ID3

Other Algorithms (cannot be visualized for now):
    12. K-Means
    13. K-Nearest Neighbor
    14. GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) using Expectation-Maximization
    15. Neural Network (with one hidden layer)
    16. Recommender Systems

Except for Recommender Systems and Logistic Regression, all algorithms can be run on the full MNIST dataset
