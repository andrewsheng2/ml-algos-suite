Note: In the GitHub repo, the MNIST training set is not included because the file is too large. Please download the train set from https://pjreddie.com/projects/mnist-in-csv/ into the data folder.

Welcome to the Machine Learning Algorithms Suite!
This suite contains the following algorithms that you can run:

Regression (can be visualized with 1D Regression Dataset): 
1. Linear Regression 
2. Linear Regression with L2 Regularization 
3. Kernel Regression with Boxcar Kernel 
4. Kernel Regression with Linear Kernel 
5. Kernel Regression with Polynomial Kernel 
6. Kernel Regression with RBF Kernel 

Classification (can be visualized with 1D Classification Dataset): 
7. Logistic Regression using Gradient Descent 
8. Logistic Regression using Newton's Method 
9. Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization using Gradient Descent 
10. Logistic Regression with L2 Regularization using Newton's Method 

Classification (can be visualized with 2D Classification Dataset): 
11. Decision Tree using ID3 
12. K-Means 

Other Algorithms (cannot be visualized for now): 
13. GMM (Gaussian Mixture Models) using Expectation-Maximization 
14. Neural Network (with one hidden layer) 
15. Recommender Systems 

Except for Recommender Systems, all algorithms can be run on the MNIST 0/1 dataset and all algorithms except for logistic regression can be run on the full MNIST dataset
